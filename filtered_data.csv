AuroraAI  - Programme with many AI examples.,"One of the experimental applications that has been run during the AuroraAI programme focused on the “moving to a place of study” life-event. Two cities involved (Tampere and Turku) carried out well-being surveys among its student populations, and - based on its results - clustered the students into the groups in need of different support. The study has discovered that factors such as reliability of the public transportation, and quality of the natural environment plays an important role in students’ well-being. Data retrieved from the study helped create a new cross-cutting public offering - a bot that would supply information about the topics that students found important. The uptake of the new service has been lackluster, leading the authorities to believe that only proactive marketing could change customers’ behaviour. Also it has been concluded that in order to pursue such projects further, municipalities need to develop user experience awareness and data analytics skills. "

IMMS (Intelligent Material Management System) for the entire library collection.  ,"An intelligent material management system was acquired while the city library moved away from library-specific collections to one shared collection. With the change, the library wanted to enable moving the material freely between different libraries. The system was introduced in May 2019, after which it has been in use but still in the deployment phase. The system has made it possible to reach a situation where the majority of the collection now floats, i.e. moves freely between libraries. IMMS gives public libraries control of collection, space, and float management. IMMS complements your existing ILS and creates an unprecedented level of transparency in your material flow. Utilizing new tools for data collection, items can be tracked to the shelf, shelving cart, transport bin, or storage location.

Automatic identification of individual risk factors in social care and healthcare ,"In October 2019, the Japanese multinational IT service provider, Fujitsu, announced that it was developing an AI solution for South Karelia’s social care and healthcare district (known by its Finnish acronym Eksote). The project employs machine learning methods with the aim of helping Eksote identify factors underlying social exclusion of young adults, as well as predicting associated risks. With the predictive model, social and healthcare professionals will be provided an overview of risk factors. According to Fujitsu’s press release, the model identifies some 90% of young adults susceptible to social exclusion. In practical terms, the model that is being used is derived from pseudonymized data taken from the use of Eksote’s services by young adults, and it uses this data to predict social exclusion outcomes defined by Eksote’s professionals. According to Eksote, the legislation on the secondary and combined use of healthcare data makes it possible to use only non-identifiable, pseudonymized data. This means that Fujitsu’s model cannot be used to identify individual young adults considered to be at risk of social exclusion; rather, the model produces a list of risk factors on a general level. The next step in the project is to examine whether it is possible, under the current legislation, to set up a consent-based system: a client’s consent would be asked for before using the predictive model on their individual data when they, for example, have an appointment with a social care or healthcare professional. "
Predicting youth problems - Identifying youth problems and providing support ," In June 2018, Eksote announced that it had developed, in collaboration with the Finnish IT firm, Avaintec, an AI model to predict problems experienced by children and the youth. The aim was to identify problems early on, so that an intervention could be made and support provided to families sooner rather than later. Much like in the 2019 project on young adults and social exclusion, this model was based on explicitly defined undesired “endpoints”: low-grade averages, disciplinary interventions at school, high-class non-attendance figures, being taken into custody, acceptance into psychiatric care, and substance abuse. The model made use of data gathered from the IT systems of maternity clinics, kindergartens, schools, healthcare, and mental healthcare providers, as well as social services – e.g., it combined data from different administrative branches, namely social care, healthcare, and education. The outcome was the identification of a total of 1340 risk factors, ranging from bad teeth in children, to parents missing maternity clinic appointments, to the child’s siblings bullying others at school. These examples also give an idea of the kinds of data that were employed when making predictions. Ideally, the model would make it possible to continuously keep track of risk factors of individual children."
State Treasury eInvoicing plans,"The State Treasury of Finland plans to automate eInvoice processing by utilising AI and robotics. It is believed that AI tools could analyse an invoice within seconds to find the necessary information such as an agreement number and amount.
